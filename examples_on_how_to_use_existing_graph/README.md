## Examples
Prior to using the examples the **slovenia-graph-neo4j.dump** should be imported in a locally hosted [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) instance and **pathways.json** should be imported in a local [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance.
- export_graph.py -> Shows how to export the database in a binary file
- shortest_route_a_b.py -> Shows how to import the binary file in a [igraph](https://igraph.org/) network analysis package and generate a sample route.
